description: Salvaging a Broken Lenovo Yoga 900
---

Due to various random circumstances I was given a Lenovo Yoga 900 with a shattered screen for free, the laptop is worth around $1200 new, but this guy had a broken screen and no charger. After getting a replacement charger and booting the computer I learned that it had an i7 processor and 16 gigs of ram and a high resolution display :flushed:. I decided to find a replacement screen on ebay for $300 and try to fix the laptop myself. Given that this was when the laptop just launcheed I had no reference or teardowns and no one seemed to have taken apart the display assembly but here's my attempt to replace the screen.


<h2> Removing the Old Panel</h2>

I found out that the screen I purchased was JUST the led assembly. So I tried to use a heat gun to melt the adhesive spereating the LED from the display housing itself and here's what I ended up with:

            title="Broken Screen"
            caption="Display Housing Removed from the Panel" %}

<h2> Now what? </h2>
Yes the entire display assembly is shattered and there's no way of reattaching the new panel to the housing.. but all the housing does is hold a few sensors, the webcam, and some antennas in place while also adhering the display itself to a back plate that attaches to the laptop itself. I decided that thick double sided foam tape would be more than enough to replace the side display housing and attach the screen to the back plate.

In addition I just used the double sided tape to attach the sensors I removed directly to the replacement display panel. Here's what it looks like:

            caption="The Entire Display" %}

Not too bad...

<h2> Filling the Space of the Display Assembly</h2>
In order to fill the missing space and attach the display to the back plate (which is attached to the laptop hinge) I used strong 3m double sided foam tape. I stacked the tape in order to make sure that the housing was evenly attached and sort of eyeballed the amount. Here's the taped up display: (notice the gray tape alone the edges)

<h2> Attaching Everything</h2>
As I attached the display to the housing I quickly realized that I had made a huge mistake attempting to stack the 3m tape. Not realizing that the back panel is slightly curved accoutning for the display itself, I used absolutely double the amount of tape I needed to fill this gap. And as a result here's what the side of the laptop looks like:

<h2> It definitely still works...</h2>

<h2> Aftermath</h2>
I decided to dual boot linux on this laptop and used it as a primary computer for a while. I love the form factor but defintiely didn't need another computer. I decided to sell it and included the fact that the display bezel was missing from the price. The broken laptop would've sold for around $200-$300 according to sold listings on Ebay. After fixing the screen I was able to get $700 so no complaints there.
