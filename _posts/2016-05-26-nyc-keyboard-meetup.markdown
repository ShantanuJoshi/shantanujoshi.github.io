I recently hosted a mechanical keyboard meetup in NYC for keyboard enthusiasts and those wanting to learn about the hobby. The details of the meetup were posted on reddit and in our meetup group [here](https://www.meetup.com/Click-clack-Mechanical-Keyboard/events/230786767/). I was incredibly surprised to find out that nearly 50 people heard about the meetup and attended. We even had Steph and Pete from [1upkeyboards](1upkeyboards.com) stop by to showcase some of their custom cables.

If you're curious about keyboards I recommend checking out the [subreddit](reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards) and perhaps even the [geekhack forums](geekhack.org).

<h2> Here's some pictures from the event. </h2>
The first album is taken by me the other two are a couple other attendees. (click to imgur for high-res pictures)
